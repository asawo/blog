## Welcome to my blog ðŸŽŠ
Thanks for coming this page ðŸ‘‹ I'm going to be posting a bunch of updates here, like some slice-of-life stuff for my family and friends, some tech stuff for those in the tech community... and geeky hobby stuff for anyone who figures out the magical combination of words to type into a google search to end up here.

You might be wondering `"Why a blog...?"`. If so, then lucky you! I've written this first blog post on exactly that topic - why I made this blog from scratch. Here's why: <br/><br/>

## I'm not a huge fan of Facebook
If you're connected to me on facebook, you probably already know that I barely post anything on there. I do use facebook for chatting to my friends over messenger, occasionally check my feed, and creep on my friends' profiles to check if I'm missing out on some hot goss from back home in Tasmania... But when it comes to posting something, I feel a bit *awkward*.

I've had my facebook account for over a decade and in that time, accumulated a lot of people in my 'friends' list. And to be honest I can barely remember who some of them are ðŸ˜… I suspect the culprit is drunk Arthur. Anyway the point is, I feel a bit awkward posting anything personal when I know that so many randos are going to be looking at what I share on facebook. 

The other thing I don't enjoy is the news feed. I don't know what I did to Facebook's algorithm and why it hates me. All I know is that it keeps suggesting weirdly addictive videos starring Gordon Ramsey at shady restaurants, antique weapon restorations, and cross-species animal friendships. Yeah I don't know. It's a bit much for me.  <br/><br/>

## To try something new 
Recently I switched careers from a translator/interpreter to a software engineer. Making a blog seemed like a fun way to keep up with the latest web technologies (like `Svelte`, which is what I used to make this blog with). 

I also have this blog hosted on a Raspberry Pi (a mini computer) which I've turned into a simple web server... and I guess this is what I do for fun now ðŸ¤“

## To document my life events
So... Since I'm awkward and don't post to facebook, I needed another place to update my family (or anyone else who might be interested) about what's happening in my life here in Japan... and maybe because a certain family member keeps bugging me to post pictures on my facebook wall ðŸ™ƒ

And so here we are with this new blog. It's super basic, but I'll keep pushing small UI and content updates from time to time. But for now, this is my initial commit to my github, where all the code for this blog lives ðŸ¤– <br/><br/>
