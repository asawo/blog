## Welcome to my blog ðŸŽŠ
Thanks for coming this page ðŸ‘‹ I'm going to be posting a bunch of updates here, like some slice-of-life stuff for my family and friends, some tech stuff for those in the tech community... and geeky hobby stuff for anyone who figures out the magical combination of words to type into a google search to end up here.

You might be wondering `"Why a blog...?"`. If so, then lucky you! I've written this first post on exactly that - why I made this blog from scratch. Here's why: <br/><br/>
## To try something new 
Recently I switched careers to a software engineer (which I'll go over in more detail in a future post). Making a blog seemed like a fun way to keep up with the latest web frameworks and technologies like `Svelte` and `Sapper`, an up-and-coming javascript compiler/framework that I used for this blog. 

I also have this blog hosted on a Raspberry Pi (a mini computer) which I've turned into a simple web server... Yes, this is what I do for fun now ðŸ¤“

## I'm not a huge fan of Facebook
If you're connected to me on facebook, you probably already know that I barely post anything on there. I do use facebook for chatting to my friends over messenger, occasionally check my feed, and creep on my friends' profiles to check if I'm missing out on some hot goss from back home in Tasmania... But when it comes to posting something, I feel a bit reluctant.

I've had my facebook account for over a decade now (I feel old saying that...). After being on facebook for that long, I've accumulated a lot of people in my *'friends'* list. And to be honest, I can barely remember who a lot of them are ðŸ˜… I suspect the culprit is drunk Arthur. Anyway the point is, I feel a bit awkward posting anything personal when I know that so many randos are going to be looking at what I share on facebook. 

The news feed isn't great either. The good old days where I see content from real friends is long gone. All I get now are ads, spam, rubbish, and videos of Gordon Ramsey roasting a bunch of shady chefs.<br/><br/>

## To better document my life events
Since I don't want to post to facebook, I needed another place to update my family about what's happening in my life here in Japan... especially a certain someone who keeps nudging me to post pictures on my facebook wall ðŸ™ƒ

And so here we are with this new blog. It's super basic, but I'll keep pushing small UI and content updates from time to time. But for now, this is my initial commit to my github, where all the code for this blog lives ðŸ¤– <br/><br/>
